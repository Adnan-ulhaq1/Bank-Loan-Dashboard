 About:

This project involves creating a comprehensive Bank Loan Report to monitor and assess lending activities and performance. The aim is to provide insights into key loan metrics and track their changes over time, enhancing data-driven decision-making and optimizing lending strategies. 
"In this project, we analyze bank loan data to generate detailed reports and dashboards. The goal is to understand the loan portfolio's health, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and identify trends that can inform better lending strategies."

Purposes of the Project:
- Monitor and evaluate the bank's lending performance.
- Optimize lending strategies based on comprehensive data analysis.

 Dashboard 1: Summary
The Summary Dashboard focuses on key loan metrics:
Total Loan Applications: Measures the total applications received, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
 Total Funded Amount: Tracks the total disbursed funds, including MTD and MoM variations.
 Total Amount Received: Assesses cash flow from borrowers, with MTD and MoM analysis.
Average Interest Rate: Calculates the average interest rate across all loans and tracks MTD and MoM changes.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluates the average DTI for borrowers, including MTD and MoM tracking.

Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
Good Loan KPIs: Includes metrics such as Good Loan Application Percentage, Good Loan Funded Amount, and Total Received Amount for loans marked as 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
Bad Loan KPIs: Covers metrics like Bad Loan Application Percentage, Bad Loan Funded Amount, and Total Received Amount for loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Loan Status Grid View:
Provides a categorized overview by loan status, highlighting metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Average Interest Rate. This view helps analyze different loan statuses and their impact on operations.
